00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.010
Before we go any further I do want to add a version control to this project.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.900
In this video we're going to create a new repo locally.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.320
We'll make a new get hub repository and we'll push our code to that get how that repository.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.510
If you're already familiar with get or get hub you can go ahead and do that on your own you don't need

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.140
to watch this video if you're just getting started and you want to treat this video as a challenge.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.240
That's great too.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.350
I highly recommend taking this video as a challenge.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.250
If you're new to get and it doesn't make sense just yet that's fine.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.100
Also simply follow along and we'll go through the whole process.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340
This one is going to be really simple nothing.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.740
Mongo DB related here to get started.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.350
I am going to go ahead and initialize a new get repository from the terminal using get in it which we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.660
explored in the previous section.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.510
This is going to initialize a new repository and I can always run and get status like this to take a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.760
look at the files that are on tracked right here we have our playground folder which we do want to add

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.840
under version control and we have packaged up Jason.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.650
We also have node modules we do not want to track this directory.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.370
This contains all of our NPM libraries to ignore node modules over inside of atom.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.690
We're going to make that get ignore or file in the root of our project.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.570
If you remember this lets you specify files and folders that you want to leave out of your version control

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.710
right here.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.080
I'm going to create a new file.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.140
Don't get ignore in order to ignore the node modules directory all we have to do is type it exactly

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.670
as it shown here.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.100
Node.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.140
Underscore modules a forward slash.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.610
I'm going to save the file rerun and get status from the terminal and what do we get.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.660
We get the get.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.230
Ignore folder showing up any node modules folder is nowhere in sight.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.280
The next thing we're going to do is make our first commit using two commands.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.560
First up I'm going to use GET add a dot to add everything to the next commit.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.720
Then I can make that commit using a get commit with the M flag.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.180
A good message for this commit would be and it commit.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.420
Excellent.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.160
Now before we go I do want to make a good home repository and get this code up there.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.740
That is going to require me to open up the browser and go to get hub dot com.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.730
Once you're logged in we can make a new repo just like we did in the previous section.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.480
I'm going to make a new repo and give it a name.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.600
I'm going to go with a node course hyphen to to do API.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.410
Excellent.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.970
You can name your something else I'm going to go with this one to keep the course files organized.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.780
Now I can go ahead and create this repository.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.910
And as you remember you get how it actually gives us a few helpful commands in this case we're pushing

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.700
an existing repository from the command line.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.290
We already went through the steps of initializing the repository outing our files and making our first

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.970
commit.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.130
That means I can take these two lines copy them head over to the terminal and paste them in.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.260
Now you might need to do these one at a time depending on your operating system.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.770
On the Mac when I try to paste in multiple commands it's going to run all but the last and I just hit

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.810
enter to run the last one.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.370
Take a moment to knock that out for your operating system you might need to run it as one command or

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.030
you may be able to paste it all in and hit enter.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.100
Either way what we have here is our code pushed up to get hub.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.220
I can prove that it's pushed up by refreshing the repository page and right here we have all of our

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.700
source code they get in your filed package.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.110
Jason and we have our playground directory with our Mongo DB scripts.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.080
That is it for this one.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.780
As promised this one is simple Sure and unrelated to Mongo D-B itself.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.620
I'll see you next time.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.610
As we explore how to delete data from a mongo IDB collection
