00:00.580 --> 00:03.330
This video you're going to learn how to use post ma'am.

00:03.450 --> 00:06.620
Postman isn't a central tool if you're building a rest API.

00:06.720 --> 00:13.020
I have never worked with a team or on a project where post man was not heavily used by every developer

00:13.020 --> 00:13.930
involved.

00:14.020 --> 00:18.240
Postman lets you create HTP requests and fire them off.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.500
That makes it really easy to test that everything you're writing is working as expected.

00:22.500 --> 00:28.650
Now obviously we will also be writing automated tests but using postman lets you play around with data

00:28.680 --> 00:32.060
and see how things work as you move through your API.

00:32.190 --> 00:35.200
It really is a fantastic tool to grab it.

00:35.220 --> 00:40.340
We're going to head over to the browser and go to get post man and dot com.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.570
And here we can grab their chrome application.

00:43.710 --> 00:48.030
Now if you're not using Chrome you are going to need to install it although you don't have to use the

00:48.030 --> 00:49.160
Chrome browser.

00:49.230 --> 00:52.380
All you have to do is install Chrome to install the app.

00:52.380 --> 00:55.320
Open up post man and you never have to use Chrome again.

00:55.410 --> 00:56.820
If you already use Chrome great.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.180
Go ahead and install that.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.640
If you are on a Mac they just introduced a Mac app..

01:01.650 --> 01:03.150
It is a great alternative.

01:03.150 --> 01:08.180
It has all the same features it's just bundled differently instead of opening Chrome to open post man.

01:08.250 --> 01:12.350
You can just open the app from Spotlight like I can here.

01:12.620 --> 01:17.060
Now I'm going to be using the chrome application since that's most likely what you'll be using if you're

01:17.060 --> 01:19.070
not on a Mac to install it.

01:19.070 --> 01:25.760
All you have to do is install the chrome app from the Chrome store click add to Chrome and it should

01:25.760 --> 01:29.810
bring you over to the page where you can open up the application.

01:29.810 --> 01:34.790
Now to open up chrome apps you have to go to this kind of weird you are Alex Krome Kallen forward slash

01:34.850 --> 01:40.790
forward slash apps here and you can view all of your apps and we can just open up post man by clicking

01:40.800 --> 01:41.370
it.

01:41.510 --> 01:47.540
Now as I mentioned post man lets you make HTP request so we're going to go ahead and make a few to play

01:47.540 --> 01:49.230
around with the user interface.

01:49.250 --> 01:55.040
You do not need to make an account and you do not need to sign up for a paid plan that paid plans are

01:55.040 --> 01:58.440
targeted towards teams of developers who need advanced features.

01:58.460 --> 02:03.850
We are just making basic requests on our machine we don't need cloud storage or anything like that.

02:03.860 --> 02:07.500
I'm going to skip account creation and we go right to the application.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.650
Here we can set up our request.

02:09.650 --> 02:14.720
This is what happens in the panel right here and down below in the whitespace will be able to view the

02:14.720 --> 02:15.550
result.

02:15.740 --> 02:19.530
Let's go ahead and make a request to Google in the you are Albar.

02:19.530 --> 02:23.740
I'm going to type HTP Kallen forward slash forward slash.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.650
Google dot com.

02:25.830 --> 02:28.430
We can click send it to send off that request.

02:28.430 --> 02:32.190
Make sure you have get chosen as your HTP method.

02:33.390 --> 02:38.320
When I fire off the request it comes back and all of the data that comes back is shown below.

02:38.340 --> 02:39.900
We have things like the status code.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.420
We have a 200 here meaning things went great.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.900
We have the time it took about a quarter of a second.

02:45.030 --> 02:46.190
We have headers.

02:46.290 --> 02:48.650
These are coming back from Google we have cookies.

02:48.660 --> 02:54.650
There's none in this case and we have our body data the body for Google dot com is an H TNL Web site

02:54.960 --> 02:59.200
for the most part the bodies that we'll be sending and getting in post man are going to be Jason since

02:59.220 --> 03:01.780
we're building out that rest a PR.

03:01.980 --> 03:06.250
So to illustrate how Jason data works we're going to make a request to the geocoding.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.620
You are out that we used earlier in the course.

03:08.730 --> 03:13.890
If you remember we were able to pass in a location and we got some Jason back describing things like

03:13.890 --> 03:17.960
the latitude and longitude and the formatted address.

03:17.970 --> 03:21.810
Now this should still be in your Krown history if you deleted your history.

03:21.810 --> 03:29.140
You can go ahead and go to Google API is right here.

03:29.290 --> 03:34.610
This is you I'll I'll be using you can simply copy it or you can grab any Jason API.

03:34.670 --> 03:35.540
You are out.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.120
I'm going to grab this one.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.240
Copy it to the clipboard.

03:38.350 --> 03:43.530
Head back into post man and swap out the L with the u are l I just copied.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.540
Now I can go ahead and fire off the request.

03:45.550 --> 03:46.620
And what do we get.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.080
We get our Jason and data down below.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.850
And this is fantastic.

03:50.890 --> 03:55.630
We're able to see exactly what comes back when we make this request and this is how we're going to be

03:55.630 --> 04:02.050
using postman will use postman to make requests to add to do's delete to do's get all of our to do's

04:02.050 --> 04:02.940
log in.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.070
All of that stuff is going to happen right in here.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.510
Remember API.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.860
They don't necessarily have a front end.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.480
Maybe it's an Android app maybe it's an iPhone app or a web app.

04:13.480 --> 04:20.350
Maybe it's a nother server so postman gives us a way to interact with our API making sure it works as

04:20.350 --> 04:21.360
expected.

04:21.370 --> 04:27.370
Here we have all of the Jason data that comes back in the raw view which is underbody we have the raw

04:27.430 --> 04:28.450
data response.

04:28.450 --> 04:30.820
Essentially it's just on prettified.

04:30.820 --> 04:34.690
There is no formatting there is no colorization.

04:34.690 --> 04:36.010
You'll save a preview.

04:36.010 --> 04:39.250
The preview is pretty useless for Jason when it comes to Jason data.

04:39.250 --> 04:43.840
I always stick with the pretty tab which should be the default.

04:43.840 --> 04:48.070
Now that we have post man installed and we know a little bit about how to use it we're going to move

04:48.070 --> 04:54.250
on to the next video where we actually create our first request and we'll be firing off a post man request

04:54.550 --> 04:56.030
to hit that you are Al.

04:56.090 --> 05:02.350
We're going to create this is going to let us make new to do's right from post man or any other application

05:02.590 --> 05:07.420
whether it's a web app a mobile app or another server that's all coming up next.

05:07.420 --> 05:12.190
So just make sure you have postman installed if you were able to do everything in this video you are

05:12.190 --> 05:13.710
ready to continue on.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.600
Stay tuned.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.230
I will see you next time.
